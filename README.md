 #### **Each file contains its modification and comment above each step of modification.**

 -  I just add more sections in HTML.

 -  In CSS style there are some change, there add style for collapse accordion.

 -  Most of the work was done through app.js, the things that have been done are :

       1. build the navigation dynamically.

       2. class 'active' to section and navigation menu item when near the top of the viewport.

       3. Scroll to anchor ID using the scroll event.

       4. hide the navbar after a delay when not scrolling.

       5. create the "Scroll to Top" button and Show/hide the "Scroll To Top" button based on user scrolling.

       6. Accordion Collapse/Expand ctions on button click.
